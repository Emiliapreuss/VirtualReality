# VirtualReality
Second semester project for the University Course "Object Oriented Programming"

The aim of the project was to create a real world simulator
in which there are different life forms with different behavior.
The project was realized using the java swing graphic library.
During the simulation, you can save its state to a file in order 
to be able to restore the simulation to the appropriate state in subsequent rounds.
